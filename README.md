# Configurational Entropy of Random Trees

This repository contains datasets of sampled branching polymers used in the manuscript:  
[Configurational Entropy of Random Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13364).

## Data Overview

The datasets were generated using two algorithms:

- **Amoeba algorithm** (generalized versions) → [`Amoeba_Data`](./Amoeba_Data)  
- **Prüfer sampling algorithm** → [`Prufer_Sampled_Data`](./Prufer_Sampled_Data)  

Each dataset is organized by:
- **N** — number of monomers in a single polymer  
- **μ** — branching (or endpoint) potential used in the ensemble  

Data files are plain-text `.dat` files, whitespace-separated.  

If you use these datasets, please cite both the manuscript above and:  
[Phys. Rev. E 110, 045312 (2024)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.045312).

## Amoeba-Generated Trees

Data generated with (generalized versions of) the Amoeba algorithm are stored in the folder `Amoeba_Data`.  
For details on the algorithm, see:  
[Phys. Rev. E 110, 045312 (2024)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.045312).

### Functionality-Restricted Trees (`f ≤ 3`)

- **Used in:** Fig. 1  
- These are the same trees analyzed in [Phys. Rev. E 110, 045312 (2024)].  
- Data is ordered first by **N** (number of monomers) and second by **μ** (branching potential).  
- Each file contains histograms: for each possible value of **N₃** (number of 3-functional branch points), the file gives the count of sampled polymers.

### Functionality-Unrestricted Trees (`f > 3`)

- **Used in:** Fig. 6  
- Generated by a generalized Amoeba algorithm allowing monomers of functionality greater than 3.  
- Data is ordered first by **N** and second by **μ** (endpoint potential).  
- Each `.dat` file contains:  
  - Column 1: polymer index  
  - Column 2: number of endpoints (monomers with `f = 1`)

## Prüfer-Sampled Trees

- **Used in:** Figs. 2, 3, 5; Suppl. Fig. S1; Suppl. Table S1  
- Generated with the Prüfer sampling algorithm described in [arXiv:2504.13364](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13364).  
- Data is ordered first by **N** and second by **μ** (endpoint potential).  
- Each `.dat` file contains:  
  - Column 1: polymer index  
  - Column 2: $R_g^2$ (squared radius of gyration) on the 3D FCC lattice  
  - Column 3: **N₃** (number of branch points)  
  - Column 4: sampling time in µs (microseconds)
